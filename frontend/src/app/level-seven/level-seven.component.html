                <h3>Hey, {{userDataStore.firstName}}!</h3>
                You have reached level 7 and are now a professor. This gives you certain rights.<br>
                You have permission to access semester-specific lectures, exam attempts, and the lecture schedule.<br>
                This allows you to manage lectures, conduct exams, and update the lecture schedule.<br><br>
                Now you want to create your own lecture.<br>
                Please make a note of the generated ID for the lecture, so you can use it in subsequent steps!<br><br>
                <b>Additional information about lectures:</b><br><br>
                The required ECTS define how many ECTS credits a student needs to be allowed to participate in this lecture.<br>
                The earned ECTS define how many ECTS credits a student gets if they pass the exam for this lecture.<br>
                The lecture type needs to be one of the following:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>"AWPF" - this means the lecture is a general education elective</li>
                    <li>"FWPM" - this means the lecture is an elective course</li>
                    <li>"VL" - this means it is a regular lecture</li>
                    <li>"SU" - this means the lecture is held as a seminar class</li>
                    <li>"P" - this means the lecture is a project</li>
                    <li>"Exercise" - this means the lecture is an exercise</li>
                </ul><br>
                You want to create an <b>elective course</b> called <b>"IT Security"</b> teaching <b>"Aspects of secure systems"</b>. The module number is: <b>"5104211"</b><br>
                Students participating in this lecture need to be in their <b>sixth semester</b> and have a minimum of <b>125</b> ECTS credits. Students passing the exam of this lecture will earn <b>5</b> ECTS credits.<br><br>

                Because your lecture "IT Security" will be held in English, you need to add a restriction to it.<br>
                Please create a <b>restriction called "Language Skills"</b> with the <b>description "Good english skills".</b><br>
                Write down the generated ID of the restriction, so you can use it in further steps!<br><br>

                Did you know that when you have a many-to-many relationship between tables, the connection between those two tables is established by a junction table?<br>
                This junction table includes the primary keys of both tables as foreign keys and may also store additional information specific to the relationship between the two tables.<br><br>
                One lecture can have multiple restrictions, and a single restriction can be linked to multiple lectures. This means that there is a many-to-many relationship between the two tables, <b>"Lecture"</b> and <b>"Restriction"</b>.<br>
                The connection between those two tables is established by a junction table called <b>"LectureToRestriction"</b>.<br><br>
                Please link your <b>lecture "IT Security"</b> to newly created <b>restriction, "Language Skills"</b>.<br><br>
